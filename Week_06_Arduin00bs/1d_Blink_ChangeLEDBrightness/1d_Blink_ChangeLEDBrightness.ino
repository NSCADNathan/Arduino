  Blink 1d - changing the timing of the LED's HIGH/LOW states to affect brightness.

  

  Most Arduinos have an on-board LED you can control. On the UNO, MEGA and ZERO
  it is attached to digital pin 13, on MKR1000 on pin 6. LED_BUILTIN is set to
  the correct LED pin independent of which board is used.
  If you want to know what pin the on-board LED is connected to on your Arduino
  model, check the Technical Specs of your board at:

// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.  
  // We changed to "13" to show that LED_BUILTIN and 13 mean the same thing!
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(2);                       // change this to affect brightness and flickering
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(12);                       // also change this to affect brightness and flickering.  
}
